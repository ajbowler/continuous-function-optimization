# continuous-function-optimization
This is an experiment with continuous function optimization, a topic in the field of Nature-Inspired Optimization. This experiment tests genetic mutation algorithms on randomly generated individuals, using the popular benchmark operation, the Sphere Function, to test fitness of each individual.

### Algorithms
This project experiments with the (1+1) Evolution Operation, with and without the 1/5th rule. The individuals generated by this operation are then mutated by Uniform Mutation, Non-Uniform Mutation, and Gaussian Mutation.

### Running
Open it up in Eclipse and run `Main.java`. It will prompt a data output format, which can be iteration number and fitness value, individual and fitness value, or fitness value only. It writes all of the trials for each run to a timestamped `.txt` file in the Trials directory (which you must create in the project) in its proper class designated folder. You can tweak the test parameters by modifying the instantiations. The defaults are 30 runs of 5000 iterations each for each algorithm.
